Lesson 1

  Lesson 1 was about the history of javascript, javascript was created in 1995 by Brandon Eich. He created javascript for the browser NetScape Navigator, 
  it was originally livescript, but it was changed to javascript however it has no relation to java.

Lesson 2

  First I learned about number and number operators, you can do calculations like 32 + 12 and number operators are like >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=. 
  These operators can be used to compare data values, then I learned about comments. Comments are useful to explain certain parts of the code that may not be easily understood 
  by others, then I learned about strings and string concatenation, strings are words like “Hello” in quotations those are strings and you can combine strings to add them   together for example; “Hello “ + “World’ = “Hello World”. I also learned about variables , variables are a way to store value, and lastly I learned about booleans, booleans are true and false statements that have a value of 1 and 0.

Lesson 3

Lesson 3 was all about conditional statements we learned about if and else statements, if else statements are basically if this is true then do this if it is not true do this. Also inside if statements you can add extra conditional statements with &&(And), | | (OR), ! (NOT). Most of this lesson was quizzes, I learned how to do else if statements and
switch statements. Switch statements are to prevent lots of if else statements based on a single value.

Lesson 4

In lesson 4 all I learned was while loops and for loops and how to nest for loops. This lesson was mostly quizzes on using loops in different scenarios. For loops are usually   the best in using all the time.

Lesson 5

   In Lesson 5 I learned a lot more about functions, how to declare a function, return, shadowing, hoisting, and function expressions. To create a function you just say 
  function Name (Value){//code}. You can also put a function inside a variable which is called a function expression, Var VariableName = function (Value){ //code }). 
  Returning is not the same thing as console.log, return means you can use that value that is returning for something more than just displaying “Hello World”. 
  Shadowing is when you have a global variable and it gets reassigned in a local variable with the same name, even though it should be local only, 0his happens when 
  you don’t create var variableName. Hoisting happens because javascript automatically loads variables first and then runs code, so all variables are the first thing to run. 
  So if you try to run a variable that hasn't been defined yet and you define that variable later instead of running into an error, it will say undefined,  so it's better to 
  declare variable first anyways to make it run properly.
  
Lesson 6

In Lesson 6 I learned about arrays, how to add, remove and modify elements inside an array, and how to loop arrays. Arrays are a way to store multiple values in one “object”, for example you can store numbers in one variable array.  You can do multiple things in an array. You can use .push(), to add things at the end of an array, you can use .pop(), to remove an element at the end of an array and .splice() to add and remove elements anywhere in an array.
 
Lesson 7

This lesson was a lot shorter, but I mainly learned about objects to create a object you var name = { //code}, you can put almost anything in a object inside objects you can put a function, if else statements, you can add values to the object like your name or numbers by using key(name) : value, make sure to add the comma at the end of a key value to add more.
