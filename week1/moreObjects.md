## Javascript Objects
- I learned more about objects this week, I specifically learned how to access object properties that have a space in them for example: `"Object Property": 1`, how to change the property value, how to add new properties to the object and how to delete them, how to check if that property exists in the object and lastly I learned that I can nest objects in objects and properties inside properties.
 ## Accessing Object Properties
-  Accessing objects is really simple. First you write the name of the object then the "key", if the key has a space in it like "Key Name" you write ["Key Name"]. so it should look like this:  `objectName["Key Name"]` and to access nested properties it would be: `objectName.keyName1["Key Name 2"]`.
  ## Changing Object Properties
  - Changing the values of an object property it would be: `objectName.KeyName = "Dog"`    in the object if any properties with the name "keyName" would be reassigned the string "Dog".  Adding new properties and their values would be the exact same way : `objectName.KeyName = "Dog"` just make sure it doesn't have the same name as any other property.  Deleting a property in an object you would have to write `delete objectName.keyName1` the property and its value will be deleted.
